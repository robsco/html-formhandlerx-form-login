=head1 NAME

HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login - An HTML::FormHandler login form.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.13

our $VERSION = '0.13';

$VERSION = eval $VERSION;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Performs login form validation, including changing passwords, forgotten passwords, and resetting passwords.

If you are working under Catalyst, take a look at L<CatalystX::SimpleLogin> or L<CatalystX::Controller::Auth>.

Login with either an C<email> B<or> C<username> parameter.

 my $form = HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login->new( active => [ qw( email password ) ] );
 
 $form->process( params => { email => $email, password => $password } );

Changing a password...

 my $form = HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login->new( active => [ qw( old_password password confirm_password ) ] );
 
 $form->process( params => { old_password     => $old_password,
                             password         => $password,
                             confirm_password => $confirm_password,
                           } );

Forgot password, just validates an C<email>, or C<username>.

Use this to create a C<token> to send to the user to verify their email address.

 my $form = HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login->new( active => [ qw( email ) ] );
 
 $form->process( params => { email => $email } );
 
 if ( $form->validated )
 {
         $form->token_salt( 'SoMeThInG R4nD0M AnD PR1V4te' );

         my $token = $form->token;
 }

Coming back from an email link, if the form validates, you would show the password reset form (carry the token in a hidden field or cookie).

 $form = HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login->new( active => [ qw( token ) ] );
 
 $form->token_salt( 'SoMeThInG R4nD0M AnD PR1V4te' );
 
 $form->process( params => { token => $token } );

When trying to actually reset a password...

 $form = HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login->new( active => [ qw( token password confirm_password ) ] );
 
 $form->token_salt( 'SoMeThInG R4nD0M AnD PR1V4te' );

 $form->process( params => { token            => $token,
                             password         => $password,
                             confirm_password => $confirm_password,
                           } );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will validate your forms.  It does not perform any actual authentication, that is still left for you.

=head2 Login

You can choose between C<email> and C<username> for the unique identifier.

Using C<email> brings in validation using L<Email::Valid>.

C<email>/C<username> and C<password> are all required fields, so will fail validation if empty.

 my $form = HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login->new( active => [ qw( email password ) ] );
 
 $form->process( params => { email => $email, password => $password } );

=head2 Change Password

Instantiate the form by activating the 3 fields: C<old_password>, C<password>, and C<confirm_password>.

All 3 fields are required, and validation will also check the C<confirm_password> matches the C<password>.

 my $form = HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login->new( active => [ qw( old_password password confirm_password ) ] );
 
 $form->process( params => { old_password     => $old_password,
                             password         => $password,
                             confirm_password => $confirm_password,
                           } );
 
 if ( $form->validated ) { }

=head2 Forgot Password

Provide the C<email> B<or> C<username> to validate, the form will then have a C<token> for you.

You can then send this C<token> to the user via email to verify their identity.

You need to supply a (private) C<token_salt> to make sure your C<token>s are not guessable.  This can be anything you like.

Tokens expire by default after 24 hours from the date/time of issue.  To change
this, either supply an epoch timestamp of when to expire, or give a human-friendly format of how long to wait.  We like things like:

 2h - 2 hours
 3d - 3 days
 4w - 4 weeks
 5m - 5 months

If you specify C<add_token_field> the value of this field in the form will be included in the token.  This can be useful when the token is sent back, to identify the user.

 my $form = HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login->new( active => [ qw( email ) ] );
 
 $form->process( params => { email => $email } );
 
 if ( $form->validated )
 {
         $form->token_salt( 'SoMeThInG R4nD0M AnD PR1V4te' );
         
         $form->add_token_field( 'email' );
         
         $form->token_expires( '3h' );
  
         my $token = $form->token;
 }

The token is comprised of a L<Digest::SHA> hash, so can be a tad long, but has much less chance of collisions compared to an MD5.

=head2 Reset Password - Stage 1

You will usually give the token to the user in an email so they can verify they own the email address.

This step is for just showing the user a reset-password form.

The first step when the user comes back to reset their password, is to check they have not fiddled with the token.

You can safely skip this step, we check the token again when they/you actually try to change the password, this just lets you stop them in their tracks a little sooner.

Setting the C<token_salt> is required, and must obviously be the same C<salt> as used in the forgot-password call.

C<add_token_field> as you did during the forgot-password process.  This will populate the unique identifier field for you. 

 $form = HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login->new( active => [ qw( token ) ] );
 
 $form->token_salt( 'SoMeThInG R4nD0M AnD PR1V4te' );
 
 $form->add_token_field( 'email' );
 
 $form->process( params => { token => $token } );
 
 if ( $form->validated ) { }

=head2 Reset Password - Stage 2

You have now shown the user a form to enter a new password (and confirm it).

Either hidden in that form, or as a cookie, you have also stored the token.

 $form = HTML::FormHandlerX::Form::Login->new( active => [ qw( token password confirm_password ) ] );
 
 $form->token_salt( 'SoMeThInG R4nD0M AnD PR1V4te' );
 
 $form->add_token_field( 'email' );
 
 $form->process( params => { token            => $token,
                             password         => $password,
                             confirm_password => $confirm_password,
                           } );
 
 if ( $form->validated ) { }
 
If you specified the C<token_field> as C<email>, you can now collect that from the form as the record to update safely.

 $form->field( 'email' )->value;

And now know which user to update.

=head1 RENDERING

This form does some subtle rendering tricks, renaming buttons and labels based on which fields are active.

=head1 TODO

Look at password type fields, pre-set char-length, etc. and/or import types from HTML::FormHandler directly.
